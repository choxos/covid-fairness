# Methods

## Data sources and study selection

We will search for open access COVID-19-related articles from medical journals available in the Europe PMC database. We will restrict our search to papers in English. We will consider papers published from 2020-01-01 to 2021-12-31 with variants of COVID-19 keyword in their title, keywords, or results. We will download all identified records in XML full-text format (for full-text evaluation) and in CSV format (for descriptive tabulations) from the database. The search query will be as follows:

(COVID-19 query for title, keywords, and results) AND (SRC:"MED") AND (LANG:"eng" OR LANG:"en" OR LANG:"us") AND (FIRST_PDATE:\[2020-01-01 TO 2021-12-31\]) AND ((IN_EPMC:y) OR (OPEN_ACCESS:y)) AND (PUB_TYPE:"Journal Article" OR PUB_TYPE:"research-article" OR PUB_TYPE:"rapid-communication" OR PUB_TYPE:"product-review")'

The COVID-19 query is available in the *covid_keywords.csv* file.

## Data extraction and synthesis

We aim to describe the use of five transparency indicators:

-   data availability,

-   code availability,

-   conflicts of interest disclosures,

-   funding disclosures,

-   statements of protocol registration.

To do so, we will use a validated and automated tool developed by Serghiou et al. [@serghiou2021] to extract the indicators from open access articles downloaded from the Europe PMC database.

Basic journal- and article-related information (publisher, publication year and journal name) will be retrieved from the Europe PMC database. We will download additional information about journal impact factors from the Journal Citation Reports.

We will use R [@R-base] for searches, data handling, analysis and reporting. The searches and data export from the Europe PMC will be conducted with the europepmc package [@europepmc]. Transparency indicators from the available full-texts will be extracted with the rtransparent package [@rtransparent]. Trends over time in transparency indicators by journal- and article-related information will be reported using descriptive tabulations and graphical illustrations, for instance using the ggplot2 package [@ggplot2].

The protocol of this study will be published beforehand on the Open Science Framework website (OSF, osf.io).

# Limitations

The study sample will be restricted to open access articles in the Europe PMC database which may not correspond to all COVID-19-related studies published in medical journals. However, as the majority of COVID-19-related papers are open access, this will not diminish the strength of our interpretations considerably.
