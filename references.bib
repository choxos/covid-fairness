  abstract = "There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting
              the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of
              stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies,
              and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly
              endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer
              to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act
              as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of
              their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on
              the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on
              enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use
              the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.
              This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR
              Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some
              exemplar implementations in the community.",

  abstract = "Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such
              research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its
              strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The
              Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
              Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on
              what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an
              observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations
              to cover 3 main study designs: cohort, case-control, and
              cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in
              September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal
              editors, to draft a checklist of items. This list was
              subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating
              group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE
              contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and
              methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent
              iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a
              checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the
              title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion
              sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all 3 study
              designs and 4 are specific for cohort, case-control, or
              cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration
              document is published separately and is freely available at
              http://www.annals.org and on the Web sites of PLoS Medicine and
              Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute
              to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.",
